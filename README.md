# SQL Trainer (SQL Playground)

SQL Trainer is a lightweight, in-browser SQL playground that allows you to practice your SQL skills. It uses `sql.js` to provide an interactive SQL environment directly in your web browser, without needing any server-side setup.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive SQL Execution:** Write and run SQL queries directly in the browser.
- **Instant Results:** View query results displayed dynamically in a table.
- **In-Browser Database:** Powered by `sql.js`, so no external database is required.
- **Sample Data:** Comes with a pre-populated `users` table to get you started.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started / Running Locally

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system. Yarn can also be used.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd sql-trainer-tailwind
    ```

    _(Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository if you are cloning it for the first time.)_

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or if you prefer yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173` (the port might vary, check your terminal output). Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

## üß™ Running Tests

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for running unit and integration tests, along with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing React components.

Available test scripts (defined in `package.json`):

- **Run all tests in watch mode:**

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn test
  ```

  This is useful during development as it re-runs tests on file changes.

- **Run all tests once:**

  ```bash
  npm test -- --run
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn test --run
  ```

  _(Note: the extra `--` is to pass the `--run` flag to the `vitest` command itself, not to npm/yarn)._

- **Run tests with a UI:**
  Vitest provides an interactive UI for a better testing experience.

  ```bash
  npm run test:ui
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn test:ui
  ```

  This will open a browser window where you can see test results, filter tests, etc.

- **Generate coverage report:**
  To see test coverage, run:
  ```bash
  npm run coverage
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  yarn coverage
  ```
  This will output a coverage summary to the console and generate a full HTML report in the `coverage/` directory.

### Test Structure

Tests are co-located with the components or pages they test (e.g., `src/components/Navbar.test.jsx` tests `src/components/Navbar.jsx`). This makes it easy to find tests related to a specific piece of code.

The tests aim to cover:

- Component rendering and basic structure.
- User interactions (e.g., button clicks, form inputs simulated via `userEvent`).
- Logic within components, often by mocking dependencies (like `sql.js` or data files) to isolate the unit under test.
- Correct feedback and state changes based on user actions.

## üßπ Linting and Formatting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and JSX, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for enforcing consistent code style.

- **Run Linter:**
  Checks for code quality and potential errors.

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn lint
  ```

  Many linting issues can be fixed automatically by running:

  ```bash
  npm run lint -- --fix
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn lint --fix
  ```

- **Run Formatter:**
  Formats all relevant files in the project according to the Prettier configuration.
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  yarn format
  ```
  To check if files are formatted correctly without modifying them (useful for CI):
  ```bash
  npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css,md}" "*.{js,json,md}" ".github/**/*.{yml,md}"
  ```

**Pre-commit Hooks:**
This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically run ESLint (with `--fix`) and Prettier on staged files before each commit. This helps ensure that code pushed to the repository adheres to the project's coding standards and formatting guidelines.

### Code Quality

- **PropTypes**: React components use `PropTypes` for runtime type checking of props, ensuring better component API clarity and easier debugging. This is enforced by the `react/prop-types` ESLint rule.

## üìÇ Project Structure

A brief overview of the main directories and files:

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows (CI, deployment) and Dependabot configuration.
- **`public/`**: Static assets that are served directly.
  - **`public/locales/`**: Translation files for internationalization (i18n).
- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - **`src/components/`**: Reusable React components (e.g., `Navbar`, `SqlEditor`). Test files are co-located here (e.g., `Navbar.test.jsx`).
  - **`src/data/`**: Static data files like quiz questions (`quizQuestions.json`) and SQL tips (`sqlTips.json`).
  - **`src/pages/`**: React components that represent different pages/views of the application (e.g., `HomePage`, `QuizPage`). Test files are co-located.
  - **`src/App.jsx`**: The main application component, sets up routing and global layout.
  - **`src/main.jsx`**: The entry point of the React application.
  - **`src/i18n.js`**: Configuration for `i18next` (internationalization).
  - **`src/index.css`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS imports.
- **`eslint.config.js`**: ESLint configuration file.
- **`.prettierrc.json`**: Prettier configuration file.
- **`package.json`**: Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration.
- **`postcss.config.js`**: PostCSS configuration (used by Tailwind).

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

This application leverages the power of `sql.js`, a JavaScript library that allows you to create and query an SQLite database entirely in the browser.

- **Database Initialization:** When the application loads, it initializes a new `sql.js` database instance.
- **Default Schema:** A `users` table is created and populated with some sample data for demonstration:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT);
  INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');
  ```
- **Query Execution:** Any SQL query you type into the text area is executed against this in-memory database. The results (or errors) are then displayed.
- **Persistence:** Note that since the database is in-memory, any changes you make (like creating new tables or inserting more data) will be lost when you refresh the page.
